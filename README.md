Warning: This is a work in progress!

The goal of this project is to set the free parameters in [Mandel, Muller 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08360) using observed pulsar velocity distributions.
The posteriors are simulated using a [modified version of COMPAS](https://github.com/veome22/COMPAS/tree/muller_mandel_kick_scatter).

The main notebook for visualizing the natal kicks produced in COMPAS is [FRONTERA_kick_dist_plots_compas.ipynb](../tree/main/FRONTERA_kick_dist_plots_compas.ipynb).
